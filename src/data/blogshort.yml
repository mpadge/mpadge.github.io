    title: The troubles with getting help files in R
    description: A primer on ways to extract the actual content of help files. Because one day people will hopefully start text-mining these things, and show us all sorts of things we never knew about the people who make R packages. When they do, this entry will hopefully help.

    title: Using RcppParallel to aggregate to a vector
    description: This article was recently published in the Rcpp Gallery, and demonstrates using the RcppParallel package to aggregate to an output vector. It extends directly from previous demonstrations of single-valued aggregation, through providing necessary details to enable aggregation to a vector, or by extension, to any arbitrary form.

    title: Github 2FA, git push, and password entry
    description: Activating github two-factor authentication (2FA) offers an indubitable security boost, with one notable side effect--https authentication requires entering a Personal Access Token instead of password. This entry explains how I reconfigured my git push commands with 2FA to be able to enter my password once again, instead of a random 32-character token.

    title: What are matrices in R?
    description: If everything in R is a vector, then what is a matrix? This entry will demonstrate that even matrices are vectors, and that processing of matrices can in certain circumstances be considerably more efficient if they are treated as simple vectors.

    title: Calling external files from C in R
    description: I recently encountered a problem while bundling an old C library into a new R package. The library itself depends on, and includes, an external "dictionary" in plain text format used to construct a large lookup table. The creators of this library of course assume that this dictionary file will always reside in the same directory as the compiled object, and so can always be directly linked. The `src` directory of R packages is, however, only permitted to contain source code, which text files definitively are not. This blog entry is about where to put such files, and how to link them within the source code.

    title: Caching via background R processes
    description: Caching is implemented because it saves time, generally by saving the results of one function call for subsequent reuse. Background processes are also commonly implemented as time-saving measures, through delegating long-running tasks to "somewhere else", allowing you to keep focussing on whatever (un)important things you were doing in the meantime. This blog entry describes how to combine the two to save double time through caching via background processes.
