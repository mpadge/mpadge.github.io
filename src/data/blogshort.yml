    title: The allcontributors package
    description: An alternative implementation in R of the original 'allcontributors.org' to acknowledge all contributors in your 'README' (or elsewhere). The original is intended to help acknowledge all contributions including those beyond the contents of an actual repository, such as community or other or less-tangible organisational contributions. This version only acknowledges tangible contributions to a repository, but automates that task to a single function call, in the hope that such simplicity will spur greater usage.

    title: The troubles with getting help files in R
    description: A primer on ways to extract the actual content of help files. Because one day people will hopefully start text-mining these things, and show us all sorts of things we never knew about the people who make R packages. When they do, this entry will hopefully help.

    title: Github 2FA, git push, and password entry
    description: Activating github two-factor authentication (2FA) offers an indubitable security boost, with one notable side effect--https authentication requires entering a Personal Access Token instead of password. This entry explains how I reconfigured my git push commands with 2FA to be able to enter my password once again, instead of a random 32-character token.

    title: What are matrices in R?
    description: If everything in R is a vector, then what is a matrix? This entry will demonstrate that even matrices are vectors, and that processing of matrices can in certain circumstances be considerably more efficient if they are treated as simple vectors.
