R has a very well structured system for documenting and accessing help
for packages. This entry describes how to extract the actual content of
help files. The `tools` package has a few functions for working with
help files, starting with
[`parse_Rd`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/tools/html/parse_Rd.html)
which claims at the outset that,

> This function parses ‘Rd’ files according to the specification given
> in <https://developer.r-project.org/parseRd.pdf>

The document referred to there tells you everything you maybe did not
ever really want to know about *how* the `parse_Rd()` function actually
does the parsing, yet not anything about how the mysterious `.Rd`
objects supposedly parsed by the function are actually accessed in the
first place. Absent that information, it remains very difficult to
figure out how to use `parse_Rd`.

<section id="Extracting-a-help-database-in-text-form" data-magellan-target="Extracting-a-help-database-in-text-form"><h2>Extracting a help database in text form</h></section>

Help files for R packages (since around version 2 at least) are stored
in a standard location, within the `"help"` directory of the local
package installation. The following code demonstrates for the `stats`
package, which includes the `rnorm()` function. Note that when you type
`?rnorm` (or `help(rnorm)`), the help page that opens up includes
details for `rnorm`, `pnorm`, `dnorm`, and `qnorm`. Also note that the
help page itself is named `"Normal"` (generally in the top left corner).
This is what is referred to as the
[“topic”](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Documenting-functions),
and is not necessarily the name of the function for which help is
sought.

``` r
loc <- file.path (R.home (), "library", "stats", "help")
list.files (loc)
```

    ## [1] "aliases.rds" "AnIndex"     "paths.rds"   "stats.rdb"   "stats.rdx"

That directory does not contain any actual `.Rd` objects, or anything
that can be submitted directly to `parse_Rd()`. And yet it does contain
all of the help information, in the format of one `.rdb` and one `.rdx`
file. As explained in one answer to [this StackOverflow
question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46184224/how-to-open-rdb-file-using-r),
these files can be loaded with the [`lazyload()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/lazyload.html).
Armed with that knowledge, the following function illustrates one simple
way to extract the contents of help files as text entries.

``` r
gethelp <- function (package, fn) {
    loc <- file.path (R.home (), "library", package, "help", package)
    e <- new.env ()
    chk <- lazyLoad (loc, envir = e)
    get (fn, envir = e)
}
x <- gethelp ("stats", "Normal")
class (x)
```

    ## [1] "Rd"

``` r
print (x)
```

    ## }

So `lazyLoad()` can be used to directly access the `.Rd` objects
containing the help files, but you first need to know the topic. If we
had not already noted that the topic for `rnorm` was in fact `"Normal"`,
then we could of course try `gethelp ("stats", "rnorm")`, but that would
just produce an error because there is no topic called “rnorm”. So is
there any direct way to find the text context of the help topic for
“rnorm”?

<section id="Digging-deeper" data-magellan-target="Digging-deeper"><h2>Digging deeper</h></section>

An alternative approach uses a trick that the [`utils::help`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/help.html)
can be called without specifying a `topic`. Additionally specifying
`help_type = "text"` will then retrieve the entire database in text
form.

``` r
package <- "stats"
h <- utils::help (package = eval (substitute (package)), help_type = "text")
class (h)
```

    ## [1] "packageInfo"

At that point, attempting to `print` the object `h` will simply open the
help file the usual way, rather than giving you the textual content.
Noting the output of the following,

``` r
str (h)
```

which (shown above in artificially condensed form) is indeed a simple
`character` vector containing the names of all of the help topics
contained within the database. So that gives us a list of all of the
topics, but we will do not know how to match `rnorm` on to its
associated topic of `"Normal"`. One approach for finding topics
associated with a specified function is to use the [`help.search()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/help.search.html)
which returns the following kinds of results:

``` r
hs <- help.search (pattern = "rnorm", package = "stats")
str (hs)
hs$matches

We can see there that the final, `"Entry"` column includes `rnorm`, and
specifies that it is an `"alias"`. The associated `"Topic"` can thus be
found simply as,

``` r
hs$matches [hs$matches$Entry == "rnorm", ]
```

    ##     Topic                   Title   Name    ID Package

    ##                       LibPath Type Field Entry
    ## 11 /usr/lib64/R/library/stats help alias rnorm

And the `"Topic"` for the `"alias"` of `rnorm` is “Normal”.

<section id="A-final-word-of-caution" data-magellan-target="A-final-word-of-caution"><h2>A final word of caution</h></section>

A final warning, by way of demonstrating how messy the business of
extracting the textual content of help files can get, comes courtesy of
the help topic `"FDist"`, again from the “stats” package.

``` r
hs <- help.search (pattern = "FDist", package = "stats")
hs$matches [hs$matches$Topic == "FDist", ]
```

    ##    Topic              Title  Name   ID Package                    LibPath Type
    ## 30 FDist The F Distribution FDist 1/76   stats /usr/lib64/R/library/stats help
    ## 31 FDist The F Distribution FDist 1/76   stats /usr/lib64/R/library/stats help

    ## 31 concept Probability Distributions and Random Numbers
    ## 32   Title                           The F Distribution

So “FDist” is the official name of one of the help topics within the
“stats” package, and therefore should also be the name of the entry
within its help database. And yet look what happens via the first of the
above approaches:

``` r
loc <- file.path (R.home (), "library", package, "help", package)
e <- new.env ()
chk <- lazyLoad (loc, envir = e)
fns <- ls (envir = e)
fns [grep ("FDist", fns, ignore.case = TRUE)]
```

    ## [1] "Fdist"

And the entry in the database is called “Fdist”, yet the content of that
entry declares a topic of “FDist”. This mismatch means that the previous
`get_help()` function will fail on the latter, and only work on the
mis-typed version of “Fdist”. It is also manifest in the official web
page for that topic having the address
<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/Fdist.html>,
with the same address using “FDist” giving an error rather than leading
to the desired page, even though the first line of the resultant page
(spelt wrongly) clearly informs you that you’re looking at a page called
“FDist” rather than “Fdist”. I could dig further into where the actual
names of the entries within the help databases come from, but that’s
likely enough to show how non-trivial this whole thing quickly becomes.
(And that little glitch will hopefully [be
resolved](https://bugs.r-project.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17927)
soon anyway.) But hopefully this has also been helpful to anyone wanting
to delve into the actual contents of R help files.
