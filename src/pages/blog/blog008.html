<section id="Databases-of-help-files-in-R" data-magellan-target="Databases-of-help-files-in-R"><h2>Databases of help files in R</h></section>

R has a very well structured system for documenting and accessing help
for packages. In most systems, attempts to access help files will result
in a dedicated window opening up with nicely formatted help content for
a requested topic. This blog entry address the issue of how to extract
the underlying text of those files, for example in order to do any kind
of text mining-type analyses.

The content of the help files can be extracted for a given package via
the [`tools::Rd_db()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tools/html/Rdutils.html).
That function works like this:

``` r
x <- tools::Rd_db (package = "tools")
class (x)
```

    ## [1] "list"

``` r
length (x)
```

    ## [1] 65

``` r
class (x [[1]])
```

    ## [1] "Rd"

Say I want to extract the help file shown on the `html` page for `Rd_db`
linked to immediately above. Then I just have to find the entry in the
`Rd_db` data. As a first try, I simply examine the names of the files in
the database, and try to match (via `grep`) the one called something
like `rd_db`:

``` r
grep ("rd_db", names (x), ignore.case = TRUE)
```

    ## integer(0)

The database contains no file called `Rd_db` or the like. If you click
again on the above link to the html entry you’ll notice that the page
itself is called, `Rdutils`. Where does that name come from? Help files
for R packages are contained within a `/man` directory of the package
source. When a package is installed, all files within that directory
(which end with a suffix of `.Rd`) are compiled into a binary database
object which can then be read by the [`Rd_db()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tools/html/Rdutils.html).
So the databases of help files for any given package contain one entry
for each file in the original `/man` directory of the package source,
with the names of those original files transferred over to the names of
the corresponding entries in the `Rd_db` file. These databases in
installed packages are no longer contained within directories named
`/man`, rather they are compiled within a directory called `/help`. The
contents of this directory can be readily examined with code like the
following:

``` r
loc <- file.path (R.home (), "library", "tools", "help")
list.files (loc)
```

    ## [1] "aliases.rds" "AnIndex"     "paths.rds"   "tools.rdb"   "tools.rdx"

And the two `tools.rdb` and `toools.rdx` files represent the binary
database of help files for the `tools` package. An alternative way to
access the databases contained within that directory is via the
[`lazyLoad()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/lazyload.html).
(And clicking on that website indicates another inconsistency that the
function is called `lazyLoad`, yet the page is named `lazyload`, for
reasons which should become clear as you read on.)

``` r
package <- "tools"
loc <- file.path (R.home (), "library", package, "help", package)
e <- new.env ()
chk <- lazyLoad (loc, envir = e)
head (names (x))
```

    ## [1] "add_datalist.Rd"    "assertCondition.Rd" "bibstyle.Rd"        "buildVignette.Rd"   "buildVignettes.Rd" 
    ## [6] "charsets.Rd"

``` r
head (ls (envir = e))
```

    ## [1] "add_datalist"    "assertCondition" "bibstyle"        "buildVignette"   "buildVignettes"  "charsets"

Those last two commands reveal that the entries in the object returned
from `Rd_db()` are the original and full file names within the `/man`
directory of the package source, while the corresponding names when
`lazyLoad`ed have the suffix, `.Rd`, removed. The following line
nevertheless confirms that the two methods yield identical results:

``` r
all (ls (envir = e) == gsub ("\\.Rd$", "", names (tools::Rd_db (package = "tools"))))
```

    ## [1] TRUE

<section id="An-alternative-approach" data-magellan-target="An-alternative-approach"><h3>An alternative approach</h></section>

An alternative approach to extract some of the information contained in
the `Rd_db` object uses a trick that the [`utils::help`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/help.html)
can be called without specifying a `topic`. Additionally specifying
`help_type = "text"` will then retrieve a few components of the database
in text form.

``` r
package <- "tools"
h <- utils::help (package = eval (substitute (package)), help_type = "text")
class (h)
```

    ## [1] "packageInfo"

At that point, attempting to `print` the object `h` will simply open the
help file the usual way, rather than giving you the textual content.
Noting the output of the following,

``` r
str (h)
```

    ## List of 3
    ##  $ name: chr "tools"
    ##  $ path: chr "/usr/lib64/R/library/tools"
    ##  $ info:List of 3
    ##   ..$ : chr [1:11] "Package:            tools" "Version:            4.0.2" "Priority:           base" "Title:              Tools for Package Development" ...
    ##   ..$ : chr [1:72] ".print.via.format       Printing Utilities" "Adobe_glyphs            Conversion Tables between Character Sets" "CRAN_package_db         CRAN Package Repository Tools" "HTMLheader              Generate a Standard HTML Header for R Help" ...
    ##   ..$ : NULL
    ##  - attr(*, "class")= chr "packageInfo"

leads to the obvious next step of examining

``` r
h$info
```

And the second component of the `h$info` object has the names and
descriptions of each entry in the help database.

<section id="Getting-help-content-for-a-particular-function" data-magellan-target="Getting-help-content-for-a-particular-function"><h2>Getting help content for a particular function</h></section>

If we want to analyse the textual content of help files, then we
obviously need a way to extract that content for any given function.
Armed with the basics described above, let’s say we want to extract the
content of the help file for the [`tools::Rd_db()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tools/html/Rdutils.html).
If you click on that link, you’ll notice that the page which describes
only the function `Rd_db()` is actually called, `Rdutils`. So how could
we automatically extract the content of the help file for `Rd_db()`, or
indeed any particular function, when the help files describing our
desired function may have entirely arbitrary names?

The full entry for `Rdutils` looks like this:

``` r
x [["Rdutils.Rd"]]
```

    ## \title{Rd Utilities}\name{Rdutils}\alias{Rd_db}\keyword{utilities}\keyword{documentation}\description{Utilities for computing on the information in Rd objects.}\usage{
    ## Rd_db(package, dir, lib.loc = NULL, stages = "build")
    ## }\arguments{
    ##   \item{package}{a character string naming an installed package.}
    ##   \item{dir}{a character string specifying the path to a package's root
    ##     source directory.  This should contain the subdirectory \file{man}
    ##     with \R documentation sources (in Rd format).  Only used if
    ##     \code{package} is not given.}
    ##   \item{lib.loc}{a character vector of directory names of \R libraries,
    ##     or \code{NULL}.  The default value of \code{NULL} corresponds to all
    ##     libraries currently known.  The specified library trees are used to
    ##     search for \code{package}.}
    ##   \item{stages}{if \code{dir} is specified and the database is being
    ##     built from source, which stages of \verb{\Sexpr} processing should be
    ##     processed?}
    ## }\details{
    ##   \code{Rd_db} builds a simple database of all Rd objects in a package,
    ##   as a list of the results of running \code{\link{parse_Rd&#125;&#125; on the Rd

    ##   and some \verb{\Sexpr} macros.
    ## }\seealso{
    ##   \code{\link{parse_Rd&#125;&#125;
    ## }\examples{\donttest{
    ## ## Build the Rd db for the (installed) base package.
    ## db <- Rd_db("base")
    ## 
    ## ## Keyword metadata per Rd object.
    ## keywords <- lapply(db, tools:::.Rd_get_metadata, "keyword")
    ## ## Tabulate the keyword entries.
    ## kw_table <- sort(table(unlist(keywords)))
    ## ## The 5 most frequent ones:
    ## rev(kw_table)[1 : 5]
    ## ## The "most informative" ones:
    ## kw_table[kw_table == 1]
    ## 
    ## ## Concept metadata per Rd file.
    ## concepts <- lapply(db, tools:::.Rd_get_metadata, "concept")
    ## ## How many files already have \concept metadata?
    ## sum(sapply(concepts, length) > 0)
    ## ## How many concept entries altogether?
    ## length(unlist(concepts))
    ## &#125;&#125;

And you’ll notice at the top that `Rd_db` is given as an `alias`. The
structure of these files is described in a section of the [“Writing R
Extensions”
manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html#Documenting-functions),
which explains that these files contain a “name”, a “title”, and
optional “alias” entries. Comparing the above text to the formatted
`html` help page for
[`Rd_db()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tools/html/Rdutils.html)
reveals what those three fields are:

1.  The “name” field defines the name of a single help topic, which may
    or may not be the name of the original `/man` directory file in the
    package source (more on this below).
2.  The “title” field specifies an arbitrary description which will
    appear at the top of the help file.
3.  The “alias” fields specify topics which will be linked to the given
    help file.

So to locate the help entry for a nominated function, we need to find
match that function with an `alias` entry for some help file which we do
not necessarily know the name of. As long as we know the package in
which we are searching, we can then simply extract all `alias` entries
for every single help file. The example in the help file for the
[`Rd_db()`](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/tools/html/Rdutils.html)
function use a non-exported function called `.Rd_get_metadata()`
(non-exported meaning that function can only be called via the
triple-colon method as `tools:::.Rd_get_metadata()`, and also meaning
that there will be no help entry for this function). This function can
be used to extract all “alias” fields for every help topic:

``` r
aliases <- lapply (x, function (i) tools:::.Rd_get_metadata (i, "alias"))
```

Code like the following can then be used to find the file which
describes the `Rd_db` function.

``` r
myfn <- "Rd_db"
aliases [which (vapply (aliases, function (i) myfn %in% i, logical (1)))]
```

    ## $Rdutils.Rd
    ## [1] "Rd_db"

And that gives us the name of the help file describing our desired
function.

<section id="Getting-help-content-for-a-particular-function-2-" data-magellan-target="Getting-help-content-for-a-particular-function-2-"><h2>Getting help content for a particular function (\#2)</h></section>

An alternative approach to finding the names of help files associated
with a specified function is to use the [`help.search()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/help.search.html)
which returns the following kinds of results:

``` r
hs <- help.search (pattern = "Rd_db", package = "tools")
str (hs)
hs$matches
```

    ## List of 9
    ##  $ pattern    : chr "Rd_db"
    ##  $ fields     : chr [1:3] "alias" "concept" "title"
    ##  $ type       : chr "regexp"
    ##  $ agrep      : NULL
    ##  $ ignore.case: logi TRUE
    ##  $ types      : chr [1:3] "vignette" "demo" "help"
    ##  $ package    : chr "tools"
    ##  $ lib.loc    : chr [1:2] "/<path>/<to>/<my>/<lib>/<loc>" "/usr/lib/R/library"
    ##  $ matches    :'data.frame': 1 obs. of  9 variables:
    ##   ..$ Topic  : chr "Rd_db"
    ##   ..$ Title  : chr "Rd Utilities"
    ##   ..$ Name   : chr "Rdutils"
    ##   ..$ ID     : chr "1/45"
    ##   ..$ Package: chr "tools"
    ##   ..$ LibPath: chr "/usr/lib64/R/library/tools"
    ##   ..$ Type   : chr "help"
    ##   ..$ Field  : chr "alias"
    ##   ..$ Entry  : chr "Rd_db"
    ##  - attr(*, "class")= chr "hsearch"

``` r
hs$matches
```

    ##   Topic        Title    Name   ID Package                    LibPath Type Field Entry
    ## 1 Rd_db Rd Utilities Rdutils 1/45   tools /usr/lib64/R/library/tools help alias Rd_db

We can see there that the final, `"Entry"` column includes `Rd_db`, and
specifies that it is an `"alias"`. The name of the associated file is
also given there as “Rdutils”.

<section id="Names-of-help-topics-names-of-help-files" data-magellan-target="Names-of-help-topics-names-of-help-files"><h2>Names of help topics; names of help files</h></section>

I indicated above that the “name” field of an “Rd” file

> defines the name of a single help topic, which may or may not be the
> name of the original `/man` directory file in the package source

An example of a help topic which differs from the name of the underlying
file arises courtesy of the `"formatC"` function from the “base”
package.

``` r
hs <- help.search (pattern = "formatC", package = "base")
hs$matches [hs$matches$Topic == "formatC", ]
```

    ##      Topic                            Title    Name    ID Package                   LibPath Type Field
    ## 18 formatC Formatting Using C-style Formats formatC 1/143    base /usr/lib64/R/library/base help alias
    ## 19 formatC Formatting Using C-style Formats formatC 1/143    base /usr/lib64/R/library/base help alias
    ## 20 formatC Formatting Using C-style Formats formatC 1/143    base /usr/lib64/R/library/base help Title
    ##                               Entry
    ## 18                          formatC
    ## 19                    .format.zeros
    ## 20 Formatting Using C-style Formats

So “formatC” is the official name of one of the help topics within the
“base” package, and therefore should also be the name of the entry
within its help database. And yet look what happens when the help
database is accessed via `lazyLoad`:

``` r
package <- "base"
loc <- file.path (R.home (), "library", package, "help", package)
e <- new.env ()
chk <- lazyLoad (loc, envir = e)
fns <- ls (envir = e)
fns [grep ("formatC", fns, ignore.case = TRUE)]
```

    ## [1] "formatc"

And the entry in the database is called `formatc` (lower-case “c”), yet
the content of that entry declares a “name” of `formatC` (upper-case
“C”). So the “Name” entry in the object returned by the [`help.search()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/help.search.html)
is not actually the name of the `/man` file in the source package,
rather it is the “name” entry specified in the actual “Rd” file.

The contents of the corresponding file can nevertheless be extracted via
`Rd_db` like this:

``` r
x <- tools::Rd_db (package = "base")
aliases <- lapply (x, function (i) tools:::.Rd_get_metadata (i, "alias"))
myfn <- "formatC"
i <- which (vapply (aliases, function (i) myfn %in% i, logical (1))) # number of entry in db
names (x) [i]
```

    ## [1] "formatc.Rd"

``` r
tools:::.Rd_get_metadata (x [[i]], "name")
```

    ## [1] "formatC"

This indicates that the `help.search()` function ought not be used to
extract the contents of help files, but that the `Rd_db()` function can
be used as illustrated above, with no need to worry about the names of
the underlying files. A final function might look something like the
following:

``` r
help_text <- function (fn_name, package) {
    x <- tools::Rd_db (package = package)
    aliases <- lapply (x, function (i) tools:::.Rd_get_metadata (i, "alias"))
    i <- which (vapply (aliases, function (i) fn_name %in% i, logical (1)))
    return (x [[i]])
}
```

<section id="Conclusion" data-magellan-target="Conclusion"><h3>Conclusion</h></section>

Hopefully this has been helpful to anyone wanting to extract the actual
contents of R help files. While the objects extracted by the methods
described above can generally be treated as `character` objects, and any
form of parsing applied, they are also objects with a defined class of
`Rd`. There are several methods already available to parse such objects,
in particular those described in the help file for the [`parse_Rd()`
function](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/tools/html/parse_Rd.html)
which claims at the outset that,

> This function parses ‘Rd’ files according to the specification given
> in <https://developer.r-project.org/parseRd.pdf>

The document referred to there goes in to extensive detail about methods
for parsing these objects.
