# GitHub notifications from the terminal

I work almost entirely from the terminal, and regret the few remaining tasks
which still require me to venture elsewhere, such as a web browser. Until
recently, one of my main reasons for constantly switching to my browser was to
check my GitHub notifications. This post describes how I view my notifications
within the terminal, including an option to mark them as "read" on GitHub. The
internal functionality is ended in R, although the functions are mere
`http::GET` calls which could easily be translated into any other language.

## The script

Like almost everything I do, I associate this with an alias, in this case `gn`
for, of course, GitHub Notifications. The alias calls the following very simple
`bash` script:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
#!/usr/bin/bash

if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
    Rscript -e "mpmisc::gh_notifications ()"
elif [ "$1" == "done" ]; then
    Rscript -e "mpmisc::mark_gh_notifications_as_read()"
else
    Rscript -e "mpmisc::open_gh_notification ($1)"
fi
```

That shows the three options currently implemented:

1. `gn` to view notifications;
2. `gn done` to mark all notifications as read; and
3. `gn <number>` to open the nominated notification in GitHub

All of these options call functions from an [R package I use to hold my
miscellaneous functions, `mpmisc`](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc).

## The `gh_notifications` functions

All of these functions are contained within [a single file of that
package](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc/blob/master/R/github-notifications.R),
itself containing less than 200 lines of code. The functions use GitHub's REST
(version 3) API, because notifications are not yet (at the time of writing)
able to be accessed via the more recent GraphQL (verion 4) API. Once they are
accessible via GraphQL queries, much more will be possible than the three
options listed above.

The main `gh_notifications()` function is a simple `GET` call to the API
endpoint, which delivers a JSON payload of notification data. From that,
I extract a few essential details including:

1. Title of the notification;
2. Repository, in `org/repo` format;
3. Issue Number (where present; not for notifications from such things as commit messages);
4. Notification URL;
5. Time at which notification updated/issued; and
6. Time at which notification or issue was last read.

These notifications are then cached for immediate recall by other functions.
Finally the notifications are printed to screen with a separate function which
formats output using [ANSII escape
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters).
The result then looks something like this:


&#8594; <span style="color:red">org1/repo2 #3</span>:<span style="color:green"> title one</span><br>
&#8594; <span style="color:red">org4/repo5 #6</span>:<span style="color:green"> title two</span>

Typing `gn 1` will then open the first notification in my default web browser.
The notifications for [the `open_gh_notification()`
function](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc/blob/master/R/github-notifications.R#L102-L133)
are loaded from the cached version, so opening is effectively instantaeous.
Finally, the REST API offers one additional function to mark all notifications
as read by issuing a `POST` command to the same API endpoint. [The
`mark_gh_notifications_as_read()`
function](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc/blob/c4fbbeb32b9a6e9ef9a10c58643fe9ea18afb470/R/github-notifications.R#L141-L151)
does exactly that, and is aliased in the above shell script to `gn done`.
