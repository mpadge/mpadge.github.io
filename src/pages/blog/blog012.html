The art of debugging C++ code in R has been covered in many other
places, notably including [this post by Davis
Vaughan](https://blog.davisvaughan.com/posts/2019-04-05-debug-r-package-with-cpp),
and [this helpful introduction](https://tdhock.github.io/blog/2019/gdb/)
by Toby Hocking, which provides a little more detail on how to get a
debugger started. The detail on starting a debugger is nevertheless
brief, and only added as an aside to the main point of the post. The aim
of this post is to provide a detailed reference on how to start a source
code debugger in R.

This blog post will not describe details of common debugging
environments, even if only because [Davis Vaughan has already done such
a great job of
that](https://blog.davisvaughan.com/posts/2019-04-05-debug-r-package-with-cpp).
As he describes there, the two most common debugging environments used
on Linux systems are [“gdb” (the GNU Project
Debugger)](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/) and
[“lldb”](https://lldb.llvm.org/).

This whole post presumes code to be debugged is in an R package, and
that all commands that follow are executed from within the root
directory of that package. Debugging code from other packages requires
modifying the following procedure to ensure that debug symbols are
inserted within the source code of those other packages. But then it’ll
generally be easier to do that from within the root directory of the
package you want debugged anyway, so we’ll just presume that from here
on anyway.

<section id="How-to-start-a-source-code-debugger-in-R" data-magellan-target="How-to-start-a-source-code-debugger-in-R"><h2>How to start a source-code debugger in R</h></section>

Starting an R session causes a computer console to enter a dedicated
computational environment where R commands can be typed, and will be
appropriately interpreted and executed. Similarly, starting a
source-code debugger generally results in entering a dedicated debugging
environment where debugging commands can be entered in order to debug
source code which has been pre-loaded into that environment.

Starting a debugger from within an R environment generally consists of
the two steps of:

1.  Re-compiling source code to include debugging symbols; and then
2.  Starting an R session in “debug” mode.

Although people experienced with debugging might see these steps as
trivial, they can easily prevent insurmountable challenges to anybody
who has never used a source code debugger before. This post will
describe a simple setup for “automating away” these two steps, and
reducing them to a single command.

<section id="Re-compiling-source-code-to-include-debugging-symbols" data-magellan-target="Re-compiling-source-code-to-include-debugging-symbols"><h3>Re-compiling source code to include debugging symbols</h></section>

While there are potentially a number of ways source code in an R package
(or elsewhere) can be re-compiled with debugging symbols, perhaps the
easiest is to insert the symbols within a `Makevars` file. These files
are used to control compilation of source code. The following line in a
`Makevars` file will insert debugging symbols when the code is
re-compiled:

    PKG_CPPFLAGS=UDEBUG -g

The code can then be compiled with an R command like
[`pkgbuild::compile_dll()`](https://r-lib.github.io/pkgbuild/reference/compile_dll.html),
and will then include the debug symbols needed in the debugging
environment.

I have a function in my [personal R package of general purpose
functions](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc), called
[`debug()`](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc/blob/main/R/debug.R) which
automatically creates a Makevars file to insert these symbols (or
modifies an existing file to add the symbols on to any existing
compilation symbols). The following section describes how this function
is used to implement a one-line command to start debugging.

<section id="Starting-an-R-session-in-debug-mode" data-magellan-target="Starting-an-R-session-in-debug-mode"><h3>Starting an R session in debug mode</h></section>

As described above, R is effectively a self-contained computational
environment within some other environment (such as a terminal
environment, or RStudio). A debugger is also a self-contained
computational environment. Unsurprisingly, this means that a debugging
environment can not be started from within R, but must be started from
the “host” environment from where you usually start R, such as a
terminal, or a shell environment in RStudio.

Debuggers also need to be started by evaluating some specified R
expression, generally specified as an external R script. This means
debugging some function, `f()`, requires creating a simple file, say
“script.R”, which calls that function. The script must include any other
lines necessary for R to know how to load the function, such as
`library()` calls, or the full function definition. For example, if I
wanted to debug a function within [my `mpmisc`
package](https://github.com/mpadge/mpmisc) - which would be silly,
because it contains no source code, but the principle applies
regardless - then I would create a “script.R” file with the following
lines:

``` r
library (mpmisc)
check <- increment_dev_version () # or whatever function I want debugged.
```

The debugger can then be started from that location by running:

``` bash
R -d gdb -e 'source("script.R")'
```

This command calls R, and must be run within a shell environment, not
from within R! The `-d` flag tells R to run in debug mode, and requires
specifying which debugger to use, such as “gdb” as in that example, or
“lldb”, or any other available debugger. The `-e` flag specifies a
command for R to evaluate while debugging.

<section id="Putting-it-together-in-a-single-command" data-magellan-target="Putting-it-together-in-a-single-command"><h3>Putting it together in a single command</h></section>

My single-command solution is implemented via a shell alias, for which
is use “debugr”, which just calls a shell script:

``` bash
alias debugr="bash /<path>/<to>/debug.bash"
```

The shell script is in [my `dotfiles`
repo](https://github.com/mpadge/dotfiles/blob/main/system/debug.bash),
and contains these lines:

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

echo "---------------------------------------------------"
echo "         Debug an R script with gdb or lldb"
echo "---------------------------------------------------"

read -p "Enter name of script (empty = default 'script.R'): " SCRIPT

Rscript -e "mpmisc::debug (); pkgbuild::compile_dll()"

DEBUGGER=gdb

if [ "$SCRIPT" == "" ]; then
    R -d $DEBUGGER -e "source('script.R')"
else
    R -d $DEBUGGER -e "source('$SCRIPT')"
fi
```

That script calls `mpmisc::debug()` to create or modify Makevars to
include debug symbols, and then re-compiles the source object by calling
[`pkgbuild::compile_dll()`](https://r-lib.github.io/pkgbuild/reference/compile_dll.html).
It also includes an interactive prompt to specify the script to be used
for debugging, with a default of “script.R”. I can then debug any
package by creating a debug script, and then simply calling `debugr` to
drop me straight into a debugging environment. As said at the outset,
this post is only intended to describe how to get that far. See the
links given at the stop for what to do once you’re there.
